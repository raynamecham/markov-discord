So, let’s all take one more step. We have learned to love ourselves, so now I urge you to speak yourself.
I would like to ask all of you. What is your name? What excites you and makes your heart beat?
Tell me your story. I want to hear your voice, and I want to hear your conviction. No matter who you are, where you’re from, your skin colour, gender identity: speak yourself.
Find your name, find your voice by speaking yourself.
I’m Kim Nam Jun, RM of BTS.
I’m a hip-hop idol and an artist from a small town in Korea.
Like most people, I made many mistakes in my life.
I have many faults and I have many fears, but I am going to embrace myself as hard as I can, and I’m starting to love myself, little by little.
What is your name? Speak Yourself!"
